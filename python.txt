Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

    Answer: list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable means changeable, Each element or value 
            inside the list is called an item. Here the items are ordered and changeable. lists are written 
            with square brackets. 
            Example: movies = ['Godfather', 'Avenger', 'Dark Knight', 'Inception']
            
            A tuple is a collection of objects which are ordered and unchangable. The differences between tuples
            and lists are tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses.
            Example: fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
            
            A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique that means no duplicates and 
            cannot be changed. A set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.sets are written with 
            curly brackets.
            Example: months={"Jan","Feb","Mar"}
            
            Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item of a dictionary has a key-value pair.
            dictionaries are written with curly brackets with keys and values in it.
            Example: cae = {"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang","year": 1964}

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô
    with space in python.
    Answer: the string data types are immutable.
            a = "I+Love+Python"
            b = a.replace("+"," ")
            print(b)

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
    the datatype of a variable in python.
    Answer: The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 and returns the unicode code.The first 128
            unicode code are same as ASCII values.The passed argument must have the length 1, if we try to pass 
            a string with length more than 1 then we will get an error.
    Example: print("unique code for A : ",ord('A'))
             unique code for A :  65
             
              The type() function is used to get the data type of a variable in python
