Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a compiler and an interpreter? Which of them is used in python language?
    Answer:                          
                                    Interpreter                                          Compiler
               Translates program one statement at a time.                Scans the entire program and translates it as a 
                                                                                  whole into machine code.

            Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze      Compilers usually take a large amount of time to 
                         the source code.                                       analyze the source code.
     
             The overall execution time is comparatively slower      overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters
                         than compilers.
    
            Programming languages like JavaScript, Python,             	Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.S
                        Ruby use interpreters

    
    
    
12. What is the purpose of PYTHONPATH environment variable?
    Answer: Python’s behavior is greatly influenced by its environment variables. One of those variables is PYTHONPATH. 
            PYTHONPATH points to many directories where extra python packages are installed. 
            for example, let's say you've created a directory, my_modules, for packages you've created that you want 
            to import into your projects.
            It is used to set the path for the user-defined modules so that it can be directly imported into a Python program. 
            It is also responsible for handling the default search path for Python Modules. The PYTHONPATH variable holds a string 
            with the name of various directories that need to be added to the sys.path directory list by Python. 
            The primary use of this variable is to allow users to import modules that are not made installable yet. 
    
    
 
 
13. How will you remove all the leading and trailing whitespaces in a string in python? Give one example.
    Answer: Python String strip() function will remove leading and trailing whitespaces. 
            If you want to remove only leading spaces use lstrip() function 
            If you want to remove only trailing spaces use rstrip() function
        
            Ex: string = ' python is awesome '
                print(string.strip())
                
                Output:
                python is awesome
    
    

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
