Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook. 

11. Write a python program to find the factorial of a number. 

    Answer: # Python program to find the factorial of a number.

            # Taking input from the user
            num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

            factorial =1

            # check if the number is negative
            if num < 0:
                 print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
            else:
                for i in range(1,num + 1):
                    factorial = factorial*i
            print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)


12. Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.

    Answer: # Program to check if a number is prime or composite

            num = int(input("Enter any number : "))
            if num > 1:
                for i in range(2, num):
                    if (num % i) == 0:
                        print(num, "is NOT a prime number")
                        break
                else:
                    print(num, "is a PRIME number")

            else:
                print(num, "is NOT a prime number it is a COMPOSITE number")



13. Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.

    Answer: # Program to check if a string is palindrome or not
          
                str_in=str(input('Enter string'))

                rev_str = reversed(my_str)

                # if the string and it's its reverse is equal than 

                if list(my_str) == list(rev_str):
                    print("The string is a palindrome.")
                else:
                    print("The string is not a palindrome.")



14. Write a Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides. 
    
    Answer: # finding third side of right angled triangle

                side1=int(input('enter side1 : '))

                side2=int(input('enter side2 : '))

                side3 = (((side1 * side1) + (side2 * side2))**(1/2))

                print(side3)



15. Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.

    Answer: # to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string
    
            from collections import Counter

            str_in=str(input('Enter string'))

            frequency_per_char = Counter(str_in)

            print ("Per char frequency in '{}' is :\n {}".format(str_in, (frequency_per_char)))
